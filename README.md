> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MegaNZDotnet is now in passive maintenance mode; I will no longer be actively maintaining it.**
> 
> This project began as a proof of concept to access the MegaUpload API several years ago, but I have never personally used it. Over the past years, I have dedicated a lot of energy to maintaining MegaNZDotnet for the community. However, I have reached a point where I lack the time and have different priorities. MegaNZDotnet will remain on GitHub and NuGet, and pull requests are welcome, but I do not plan to actively fix issues or add features.
